# AnimalUML

## Introduction
In this project I want to implement the PlantUML with cpp. 

I make this project for some reasons below:

1. I want to learn dot languge.
2. I want learn UML again.
3. This is a profe that I can program cplusplus in public.
4. The rules which came from my experience I want use them in projects.

This world changes, the cplusplus is not as popular as before, I still insist making cpp, I don't know I'm right or not.

## Requirement
1. of course STL
2. graphviz
